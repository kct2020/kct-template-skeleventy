## Uric Acid Treatment Guideline 2020

This review continues my earlier review of <a href="blog/gout-pain-relief-best-practice">Gout Pain Relief Best Practice</a>. So I recommend that you read that first. In particular, my comments about Scope and Intent apply here. But here's a quick recap:

- This review helps you discuss treatment choices with your doctor.
- The ACR guideline summarizes published gout research. So it is not fully inclusive.
- The guideline stresses that patient needs and preferences will override many recommendations.

## Uric Acid Treatment Recommendations

The uric acid treatment recommendations are spread across 5 sections. So I will create 5 separate reviews, linked below.

1. Indications for pharmacologic Urate-Lowering Therapy
2. Recommendations for choice of initial Urate-Lowering Therapy for patients with gout
    1. Timing of ULT initiation
3. Recommendations for all patients taking Urate-Lowering Therapy
    1. Duration of ULT
4. Recommendations for patients taking specific Urate-Lowering Therapy medications
    1. Allopurinol
    2. Febuxostat
    3. Uricosurics
5. When to consider switching to a new Urate-Lowering Therapy strategy

## Your Best Uric Acid Treatment

Please keep returning to read the detailed reviews as I publish them.
